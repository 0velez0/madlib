# MadLib
In this project, you will explore handling input events and submission by create a [Mad Lib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) game.

This is a [Stage]() project. You will be submitting a PR for this project at the end.

## Learning Goals
- Extend code provided
- Practice using events
- Pass custom information to an event handler function
- Dynamically construct components based on data

## Scaffolding
The data structure that drives the UI is madlibs/MadLibs.js. To complete your objectives, you will not need to modify this file. The data in this file is an array of Madlib objects. A MadLib object has three properties that you'll utilize:
- `title` - the title of the Madlib
- `words` - an array of fill-in-the-blank 'word' objects (these objects contain a `key`, `label`, and `value` property)
- `getText()` - a function that returns the Madlib text
